# ASCII Tree Generator

This C++ program generates a simple tree-like structure using ASCII characters. The tree consists of branches and a trunk, where the height of the tree is input by the user. The program uses recursion to print the tree with symmetry.

## Features
- Generates a tree structure with ASCII characters (`*`).
- Customizable tree height.
- Ensures the trunk width is always odd for visual symmetry.
- Validates user input to ensure tree height is at least 3.

## Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++).

## Compilation and Execution

1. Compile the program:

   ```bash
   g++ tree.cpp -o tree
